Justin Peters persecuted Jesus in this video:

• youtube.com: Didache - Bethel Heresy You Have To See To Believe

There's nothing wrong with either of these Bethel teachers teachings which
Justin Peters has made a mockery of, and here are Scriptures to back up my
position:

Saul was persecuting Jesus when Saul was persecuting Christians. In other
words, Jesus takes it personally when Christians experience persecution.

Acts 9:4 - And falling to the ground he heard a voice saying to him, Saul,
Saul, why are you persecuting me? (ESV)

About "forgiving" Jesus, it's about not bearing a grudge against Jesus for
what His body has done, it is for our own good that we "forgive" and not bear
a grudge:

Leviticus 19:18 - You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the
sons of your own people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am
the LORD. (ESV)

I John 3:15 - Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that
no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. (ESV)

Colossians 3:14 - And above all these put on love, which binds everything
together in perfect harmony. (ESV)

II Corinthians 11:2 - I feel a divine jealousy for you, for I betrothed you
to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. (ESV)
