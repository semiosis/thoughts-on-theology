Justin Peters persecuted Jesus in this video:

• youtube.com: Didache - Bethel Heresy You Have To See To Believe

There's nothing wrong with either of these Bethel teachers teachings
which Justin Peters has made a mockery of, and here are Scriptures
to back up my position:

Saul was persecuting Jesus when Saul was persecuting Christians. In
other words, Jesus takes it personally when Christians experience
persecution.

Acts 9:4 - And falling to the ground he heard a voice saying to him,
Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? (ESV)

About "forgiving" Jesus, it's about not bearing a grudge against
Jesus for what His body has done, it is for our own good that we
"forgive" and not bear a grudge:

Leviticus 19:18 - You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge
against the sons of your own people, but you shall love your
neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD. (ESV)

I John 3:15 - Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you
know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. (ESV)

Colossians 3:14 - And above all these put on love, which binds
everything together in perfect harmony. (ESV)

II Corinthians 11:2 - I feel a divine jealousy for you, for I
betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to
Christ. (ESV)
